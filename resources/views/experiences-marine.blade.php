        <p>The Marine department is based in Paris and is in charge of acquiring, maintaining and optimising tank ships and barges for the Perenco group. Marine can also take action on any marine environment related issue. The team is composed of sailors and engineers who maintain one of the largest fleet in West Africa and manage floating production, storage and offloading units (FPSO) replacement projects to strengthen the competitiveness of our terminals.</p>

              <div class="ans-box"><p>One of the main missions of the Marine department is to supervise oil terminals integrity management and provide technical support to subsidiaries.</p>
    
    <p>Perenco has the largest fleet in the region with six floating units in West Africa.</p>
    
    <p>The fleet is composed of Floating Storage Units (FSO) and floating production, storage and offloading units (FPSO). These tank ships are particularly effective in areas located far off the coast and offer an economically attractive solution to collect the oil produced on platforms and store it; and for FPSO, treat it by separating effluents (water, gas and crude). These terminals also serve as an export point for the delivery of crude to our customers</p>

      <p>The role of the Marine department is to manage and maintain these facilities. We are responsible for monitoring norms and technical standards, ensuring the operability of our vessels and maintaining their classification with certifying bodies such as Bureau Veritas.</p>
    
    <p>Our tanks have a special rating because they are no longer navigating. Their immobilisation has an impact on maintenance, since these vessels cannot be put in a dry hold. Any works required must thereby be performed at sea without interrupting storage and removal activities, which sets unique and particularly interesting challenges.</p>

              <div class="ans-box"><p>A second component of our activity is to develop projects aimed at improving the operability of our fleet. For example we can equip a floating terminal with a remote boost pump set on a mooring buoy to minimise risks and provide greater comfort to our customers during removal phases. It is a real value creation that can increase the final price of the product.</p>
    
    <p>We also manage the acquisition of new facilities and the renewal of our fleet. We regularly need to replace an aging floating unit. In this case our role is to identify a boat on the market, purchase it and shape its transformation according to our needs. The future terminal must be adapted to our work and to the climatic conditions of its new destination while answering our storage and processing requirements. Following conversion, the last steps are routing until the production site and connection. Such a large scale project can last about two years. Our latest acquisition is representative of the way we operate.</p>

      <p>The team at headquarters is composed of specialised marine engineers (hydrodynamics, flow dynamics or naval architecture) and merchant marine officers, former graduates of Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Marine (National Superior Maritime School) with a first sailing experience. This is the case for Perenco fleet manager and offshore terminals (OTS) superintendents.<br />
    <br />
    On board teams are governed by maritime rules and so they must adhere to the safety and organisation standards of the vessel flag and category.<br />
    As for engineers their mobility varies depending on projects. They may be asked to follow a conversion somewhere on a ship yard for several months.</p>
