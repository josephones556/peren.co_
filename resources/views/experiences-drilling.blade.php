        <p>The Drilling department is in charge of undertaking exploration and development drilling to maximise production on our mature fields and ensure all our producing wells are well-maintained until the end of their lives. It is a fully integrated activity that brings together over 90 people at headquarters and in subsidiaries, all fully involved and dedicated to safety and environment compliance. Today Perenco manages twelve drilling devices and 30 work-over units on land and at sea throughout the world for a portfolio of over 3,000 wells.</p>

              <div class="ans-box"><p>The Drilling department operates from the acquisition phase or preliminary project by carrying out Prospective Studies to assess the profitability potential of an asset. We analyse well characteristics and estimate operating costs required to maintain or drill new wells, while securing a high-performance production.</p>
    
    <p>With regard to our assets in Africa, Latin America, Asia and the North Sea, which are mostly mature fields our objective is to maximise returns by operating differently.</p>
    
    <p>The headquarters team designs and plans drilling projects in the short, medium and long term, either at a three or five-year horizon.</p>

      <p>We determine which type of development and how much investment is required to successfully complete our projects. We also act as technical support for our subsidiaries to prepare the works, design well architecture, manage operations and secure long-term follow-up with our teams on-site.</p>
    
    <p>Our maintenance activity or workover is crucial for Perenco. We mostly operate to optimise production or repair defective equipment.</p>
    
    <p>Whatever our assignment may be, we systematically rethink our approach.</p>

              <div class="ans-box"><p>Drilling is primarily a job for engineers who like technical aspects. The ability to manage the unexpected and to take crucial decisions at any time is also essential. It goes hand in hand with a good resilience to stress. This job also demands a lot of professional availability since most drilling careers are spent abroad.</p>
    
    <p>Our collaborators need to be extraordinarily mobile and able to adapt easily. Because of all these components this job is a great management school. Drilling and well engineering is a natural route to drilling management jobs, but it also prepares for leadership in other roles.<br />
    <br />
    Alongside our engineers we employ mechanics, engineers, hydraulic technicians, and less qualified but more experienced profiles, who often start as a workers and progress as surface operators, site managers or drilling/ work-over supervisors.</p>

              <div class="ans-box"><p>In addition to our partnerships with the IFP School (French Institute of Petroleum), we have created a dedicated training in partnership with the French School of Drilling.</p>
    
    <p>Twice already, we have trained ten young people with technical profiles (mechanical, instrumentation or civil engineering) and personalities suited to our business sector.</p>
    
    <p>We have developed a specific programme over two years based on a combined work-study training. Today these twenty candidates are work-over or drilling supervisors and operate on our sites all over the world.</p>

      <p>Security and environmental policies are key for Perenco and form an integral part of our activity as much as other performance indicators. The Drilling department has a HSE manager in charge of upstream risk prevention who also works with on-site teams, organises awareness campaigns, training exercises and ensure the equipment deployed is suitable. We are also extremely vigilant to the environmental impact of our operations.</p>
